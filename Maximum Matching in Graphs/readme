The main programs are:
LP5Lev1
LP5lev3

The level LP5Lev1 is running correctly but the LP5Lev3 is going into an infinite loop.

javac LP5Lev1.java
java LP5Lev1 filename.txt (VERBOSE)

The program takes 1/2 arguments:
1. file name
2. VERBOSE(Any string as second command line argument will do).

If no command line arguments are given input is taken from the command line.
